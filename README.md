# Progressbar95 Alphabeth Recreation | [[Download]](https://github.com/Progressbar-Discord-Server/alphabeth-recreation/releases/tag/1.0.0)

I remade the unreleased Alphabeth gamemode in GameMaker from what I remember from playing it. There was never a win/lose condition in the game, so this is all the gameplay was.

Confused on what Alphabeth is? [Check out the Progressbar95 wiki article](https://progressbar95.fandom.com/wiki/Alphabet_game_mode)

**NOTE:** This is a recreation from memories that I had from playing it. Some things may be incorrect!
